The following edits were made to inventory_screen
    -Added cards through search show up on home_screen
    -clicking the circle icon extends an information dropdown with name, - (minus), # cards owned, +(plus); clicking again
        collapses it
    -pressing the plus or minus increments and decrements the number of the selected card owned, respectively; a count of 0
        results in card object being removed from list entirely

The addCard() function has been updated -
    -If the card to be added has the same name as a card in the inventory, a new MagicCard is not added, rather the card 
        already in the inventory's numOwned variable is increased by owned
